1) An introduction: HgTe-based topological insulators. Dimensional quantization 
and an effective model for two bands. Topological invariant. 
Edge states and absence of backscattring due to
time--reversal symmetry. 
2) Experimental results: edge states exist and drive the transport. No localization is 
observed, but the conductivity is well below the conductivity quantum. Source of
backscattering?

3) Bulk bound state: energy, wave function. 
4) Edge reconstruction.
5) Numerical diagonalization results: edge states with obstacles, magnetic impurities.
6) Conclusion: the mechanisms described, although theoretically possible, aren't likely to 
work in reality.
