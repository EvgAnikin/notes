  Abstract                 = {We present an effective medium theory that explains the disorder-induced transition into a phase of quantized conductance, discovered in computer simulations of HgTe quantum wells. It is the combination of a random potential and quadratic corrections proportional to p^2 sigma_z to the Dirac Hamiltonian that can drive an ordinary band insulator into a topological insulator (having an inverted band gap). We calculate the location of the phase boundary at weak disorder and show that it corresponds to the crossing of a band edge rather than a mobility edge. Our mechanism for the formation of a topological Anderson insulator is generic, and would apply as well to three-dimensional semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling.},

We demonstrate the existence of topological edge states at the periphery of single-layer WTe2 islands. Surprisingly, we also find a band gap in the bulk and the semiconducting behaviors of the single-layer WTe2 at low temperature, which is likely resulted from an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) transition. The realization of two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) thus provides a promising platform for further exploration of the 2D TIs' physics and related applications.},
